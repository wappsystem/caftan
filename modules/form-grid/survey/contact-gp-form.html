                            The ‘CAFTAN’ study will investigate the effects of cannabidiol (CBD) on anxiety in young
                            persons with anorexia nervosa who are about to commence Maudsley Family-Based
                            Treatment (MFBT) in the community and are in the care of a medical practitioner (GP or
                            paediatrician).

                            The study aims to determine the safety and effectiveness of cannabidiol – the non-
                            intoxicating component of the cannabis plant – on anxiety during MFBT.

                            CBD has demonstrated promising reductions in treatment-resistant anxiety in young
                            persons. We believe CBD may reduce the anxiety-provoking refeeding phase of MFBT
                            thereby improving the young person’s response to therapy.

                            There is no placebo group, which means all participants receive the CBD medication.

                          <p class="textleft">
                            Cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, is one of more than 100 cannabinoids (chemical
                            substances) found in the cannabis plant. CBD is thought to possess anti-anxiety, anti-seizure,
                            and anti-psychotic properties, and is being widely studied across a range of indications.

                            4) Does the study drug make you “high” or intoxicated? How will it be administered?
                          </p>
                          <p class="textleft">
                            No, the study drug contains &gt;99% pure plant-derived CBD administered as a soft-gel
                            capsule.
                          </p>
                          <p class="textleft">
                            Unlike tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis, CBD is not
                            intoxicating meaning it does not cause a characteristic “high” that people often associate
                            with cannabis.

                            5) Is it possible to become addicted to CBD?
                          </p>
                          <p class="textleft">
                            No, it is not possible to become addicted to CBD.

                          <p class="textleft">
                            CBD is not intoxicating, and studies do not show evidence of abuse potential or tolerance
                            and dependence with CBD.

                          <p class="textleft">
                            CBD is a controlled medicine in Australia. This means that CBD-containing products can only
                            be legally accessed on prescription by a doctor via the Therapeutic Goods Administration
